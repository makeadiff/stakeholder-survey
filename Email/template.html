Hi %NAME%,<br />

<p>How you doin?</p>

<p>We are curious because after a lot of research and analysis we have come to the fairly obvious conclusion that if our volunteers are happy, our children are happy. And in MAD, we really want our children to be happy.</p> 

<p>So we have decided to ask you on a very regular basis how happy you are with MAD so that we can ensure that you don't just have a great experience but instead have an extraordinary experience while volunteering in MAD. All you have to do is log into MADapp.</p>

<ul>
<li>URL: <a href="http://makeadiff.in/apps/stakeholder-survey/form.php">http://makeadiff.in/apps/stakeholder-survey/form.php</a></li>
<li>Username: %EMAIL%</li>
<li>Password: %PASSWORD%</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the "<a href="http://makeadiff.in/apps/stakeholder-survey/form.php">How you doin?</a>" link and answer four simple questions. </p>

<p>All your answers are anonymous but we aggregate this information at the city and national level to figure out where we can improve. So please be brutally honest because this will really help us become a stronger organisation in the months to come. </p>

<p>So yes, you are in the spotlight and we have only one question to ask you...</p>
